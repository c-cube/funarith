# Funarith

Functorial implementation of classic algorithms for arithmetic, in OCaml.

## Planned features

We should have at least:

- [x] simplex for â„š
- [ ] simplex + branch&bound for Z
- [x] solving systems of linear diophantine equations
- [ ] omega for Z
- [ ] Cooper for Z (quantifier elimination)
